# An Analysis of stock-analysis
## Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analysis is that Steve wants to get any dataset that he wants to know in the entire stock analysis over the few years. By using the code in VBA for looping through all the data, he can collect the data information he wants with one click button. It will helps to save a lot of times and memories without any added formatting in excel. Also, by taking few steps, using code in VBA is very sufficient for time saving because executing the data from VBA is faster to run. He can also easily add more data in the VBA so as to get any data information output he wants instead of typing and adding formatting in the excel. I confirmed that how much time refactored code output in VBA system takes to get stock analysis for 2017 and 2018 in the same sheet.

## Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

As shown this image, the data run in 0.6 seconds to get stock analysis for 2017 ![VBA_Challenge_2017](https://github.com/msjj622/Stock-analysis/blob/main/VBA_Challenge_2017.png). Also, the image of ![VBA_Challenge_2018](https://github.com/msjj622/Stock-analysis/blob/main/VBA_Challenge_2018.png), stock analysis for 2018 took 0.09 to get data. It is clearly shows that it only  takes few seconds to get any data I want between two different dataset of excel files by refactoring code in VBA.

To get timer and the year of tock analysis I want to is to type the code as to shown the image, ![Run_time](https://github.com/msjj622/Stock-analysis/blob/main/Run_Time.png) and to get the result of execution time as the two first above image, you put the code for timer at the end of line ![Timer](https://github.com/msjj622/Stock-analysis/blob/main/Timer.png).


## Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
- What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code? 
Advantages of refactoring code is to better quality code as well as well maintenance activities that you can easily add more data and get the data results in a short time. Disadvantages of refactoring code is that you might have to re-test alot of time for the results. However, once you setup the pipeline, it is automated data frame and you can get any dataset you like to get easily.

- How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
It was very hard to get the results of requirements. The original VBA had a very short codes and applying the refactored codes was a lot larger. There were a lot of things to considering for structures such as creating tickers in 2017 and 2018 as well as based on the each year of tickers get their own data results in one sheets and the results needs to be colour coded based on the values of stock persentages. To get the results, I tested thousands of times. But having the frames, it is now easy to process data sets for each year of tock analysis.
